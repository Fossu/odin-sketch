# odin-sketch

This code creates a 16x16 grid on a page that takes 600px 
of height and 600px of width. Each box then changes color to a random one
after mouseovered. Each time same box is hover on the brightness goes down
by 0.1. A new number of boxes per row/column can be entered in the field 
at the top, this resets the grid in the same 600x600 area just 
with specified number of boxes and allows for a new sketch.
